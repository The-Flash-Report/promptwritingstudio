Test different approaches (questions, numbers, personalization) with A/B testing. Also, use the Re-engagement Email Campaign prompt to win back inactive subscribers.

    },
    {
      "question": "How long should my marketing emails be?",
      "answer": "The ideal email length depends on your purpose and audience. For promotional emails, keep them concise (150-200 words) with clear CTAs. For newsletters and educational content, 300-500 words often works well. Welcome emails and abandoned cart emails should be brief and focused. Our email prompts are designed to create appropriately sized emails for each purpose, but you can always request shorter or longer versions based on your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I make my emails more personalized beyond using the subscriber's name?",
      "answer": "True personalization goes beyond using a subscriber's name. Use our prompts to create segmented content based on subscriber behavior (pages visited, products viewed), purchase history, or quiz/survey responses. Modify the prompts to include conditional sections based on subscriber attributes. For example, in the Welcome Email Sequence prompt, you can specify different content for segments like 'new to the industry' versus 'experienced professionals' to create truly personalized journeys."
    },
    {
      "question": "How frequently should I send marketing emails?",
      "answer": "Email frequency depends on your industry, content value, and audience preferences. Most businesses find success with 1-4 emails per month for newsletters and regular communications. For specific campaigns like welcome sequences, follow the timing recommendations in our Welcome Email Sequence prompt (typically more frequent initially, then tapering off). The best approach is to set expectations during signup and then test different frequencies with your specific audience to find the optimal balance."
