      "question": "Is using AI for academic work considered cheating?",
      "answer": "The ethical use of AI in academics depends on how it's used and your institution's policies. Using AI as a learning tool, brainstorming assistant, or to help organize information is generally acceptable. However, submitting AI-generated content as your own work without substantial revision, critical thinking, and proper citation would be considered academic dishonesty. Always: 1) Check your institution's AI policy, 2) Use AI to enhance your thinking, not replace it, 3) Substantially revise and critically evaluate any AI-generated content, 4) Be transparent with instructors about AI use when appropriate, and 5) Cite AI assistance if required by your institution's guidelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I ensure the academic information from these prompts is accurate?",
      "answer": "AI-generated academic content should always be verified. To ensure accuracy: 1) Cross-reference key facts, theories, and concepts with your course materials and reputable academic sources, 2) Be especially cautious with specific statistics, dates, author names, and technical terminology, 3) Use AI-generated content as a starting point for your own research rather than a definitive source, 4) Ask your AI to provide reasoning and sources for its information, then verify those sources, and 5) Remember that AI may present plausible-sounding but incorrect information, especially for specialized or cutting-edge topics. The responsibility for academic accuracy ultimately rests with you as the student."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I adapt these prompts for different academic disciplines?",
      "answer": "To adapt these prompts for specific disciplines: 1) Add discipline-specific terminology and frameworks (e.g., for psychology, specify which theoretical approach to use—cognitive, behavioral, psychodynamic), 2) Modify the output format to match conventions in your field (e.g., lab reports for sciences, case analyses for business), 3) Specify the preferred citation style for your discipline (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.), 4) Include relevant methodological approaches (qualitative vs. quantitative, specific research methods), and 5) Reference key scholars or seminal works in your field that should inform the response. The more specific you are about disciplinary conventions, the more tailored and useful the output will be."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can these prompts help with learning difficult concepts, not just completing assignments?",
      "answer": "Yes, these prompts can be powerful learning tools beyond assignment completion. For difficult concepts: 1) Use the Study Guide Creator to break down complex topics into manageable components, 2) Ask ChatGPT to explain concepts in multiple ways or using different analogies, 3) Generate practice questions at increasing difficulty levels to test your understanding, 4) Create scenarios where you need to apply theoretical concepts to real-world situations, and 5) Use the Socratic method by asking ChatGPT to pose questions that guide your thinking rather than providing direct answers. The most effective approach is using these prompts to create active learning experiences rather than passively consuming information."
