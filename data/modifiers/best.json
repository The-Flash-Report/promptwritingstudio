    {
      "question": "What makes these prompts better than basic ChatGPT prompts?",
      "answer": "These prompts are superior because they incorporate advanced prompting techniques like role specification, detailed context provision, multi-step instructions, and specific output formatting. They're designed based on extensive testing to overcome ChatGPT's limitations such as vagueness, hallucinations, and generic responses. Each prompt includes specific elements that elicit more detailed, accurate, and useful responses by providing clear guidance on exactly what information to include and how to structure it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I modify these prompts for my specific needs?",
      "answer": "To customize these prompts, first identify which sections need modification while preserving the overall structure that makes them effective. Replace placeholder text (in brackets) with your specific details. Add context about your particular situation, industry terminology, or requirements. Adjust the output format to match your preferences by modifying the numbered list of requested elements. For best results, maintain the prompt's instruction clarity and specificity even as you customize the content."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine multiple prompt templates for more complex tasks?",
      "answer": "Yes, combining prompts can be very effective for complex tasks. The best approach is to identify the core elements from each prompt that are relevant to your task and integrate them into a cohesive structure. Maintain the clear instruction format and specificity from each source prompt. For very complex tasks, consider using a sequential approach where you use one prompt to generate initial content, then feed that output into a second prompt for refinement or transformation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know which prompt will work best for my specific situation?",
      "answer": "Select prompts based on your desired outcome rather than your input type. Consider what format and depth of information would be most valuable to you. For exploratory work, choose prompts that emphasize multiple perspectives or comprehensive research. For practical tasks, select prompts focused on actionable outputs. When uncertain, the Universal Expert Framework is often a good starting point as it can be adapted to most situations. Don't hesitate to experiment with different prompts for the same task to see which produces the most useful results for your specific needs."
