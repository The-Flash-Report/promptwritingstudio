Our ATS-Optimized Resume Generator prompt helps you create a resume that addresses these factors while remaining readable for human recruiters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I include the same skills on every resume I send out?",
      "answer": "No, you should customize your skills section for each job application. Use our Resume Skills Section Optimizer prompt to identify which of your skills align with each specific job description. This targeted approach significantly increases your chances of passing ATS screening and catching a recruiter's attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should my resume be?",
      "answer": "For most professionals, a one-page resume is ideal. Those with 10+ years of relevant experience may extend to two pages. Our resume prompts are designed to help you create concise, impactful content that fits these length guidelines while highlighting your most relevant qualifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I quantify achievements if my work doesn't have obvious metrics?",
      "answer": "Even in roles without clear metrics, you can quantify your impact by considering: volume of work (number of projects/clients), time savings, efficiency improvements, team size, project scope, or positive feedback rates. Our Resume Achievement Bullet Points prompt can help you identify and articulate these less obvious metrics in a compelling way."
