      "example": "A vast underground fungal forest cavern where bioluminescent mushrooms the size of redwood trees stretch toward a ceiling lost in darkness. Massive cap structures in vibrant cyan, magenta, and amber create a natural canopy, their undersides releasing gently falling spores that illuminate the misty air like floating stars. The forest floor is a tapestry of smaller fungi, moss-covered rocks, and shallow pools of crystal-clear water that reflect the glowing canopy above. Ancient stone ruins of a forgotten civilization are partially reclaimed by fungal growth, with crumbling archways and weathered statues emerging from the caps and stems. Thin beams of natural light pierce through rare openings in the distant ceiling, creating dramatic god rays where they interact with the spore-filled air. The color palette centers on deep blues and purples in the shadows with electric blues, magentas, and amber accents from the various bioluminescent species, creating an otherworldly, mystical atmosphere. Small creatures similar to glowing jellyfish float through the air currents, while a caravan of diminutive explorers with lanterns winds along a path at the base of one massive mushroom stem, emphasizing the enormous scale of the environment. Rendered in a painterly concept art style with influences from luminism and fantasy illustration, viewed from a dramatic three-quarter elevated perspective that showcases the vastness of the cavern while providing clear detail of the forest floor, 21:9 cinematic aspect ratio.",

      "category": "Artistic Style",
      "example": "A bustling night market in Tokyo rendered in the distinctive style of Blade Runner concept artist Syd Mead, featuring narrow streets lined with neon-lit food stalls and holographic advertisements that cast vibrant reflections on the rain-slicked pavement. The scene combines Mead's signature retrofuturistic industrial design elements with precise technical detailing—exposed pipes, angular architectural forms, and mechanical components integrated with everyday objects. The color palette features deep blues and blacks punctuated by intense neons in magenta, cyan, and amber, with the characteristic high-contrast lighting that creates dramatic silhouettes and rim lighting on the market vendors and patrons. Atmospheric perspective creates depth through layers of illuminated steam and fog that diffuse distant light sources. The composition employs Mead's typical slightly elevated perspective with exaggerated vanishing points that draw the eye through the scene, while his distinctive rendering technique combines photorealistic elements with technical illustration precision. The mood evokes retro-futuristic optimism tinged with urban grit, capturing Mead's vision of lived-in futures where high technology meets everyday human activity. Rendered as a highly detailed concept illustration with cinematic framing in 16:9 aspect ratio, ultra-high definition quality.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I adapt these image prompts for different AI generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion?",
      "answer": "Each AI image generator has slightly different strengths and syntax preferences. For DALL-E, focus on clear, straightforward descriptions with less technical jargon. For Midjourney, you can include specific parameters like --ar for aspect ratio and stylistic modifiers like 'highly detailed' or 'photorealistic.' For Stable Diffusion, detailed prompts work well, and you can include specific artist references. With any platform, start with our base prompts and then add platform-specific parameters or adjust the wording based on your results. Test different variations to see what works best with your specific generator."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are my generated images not matching my prompts exactly?",
      "answer": "AI image generators interpret prompts probabilistically rather than literally. To improve accuracy: 1) Prioritize important elements by placing them earlier in your prompt, 2) Be specific about details that matter most to you, 3) Use concrete descriptors rather than abstract concepts, 4) Include artistic style references that match your vision, 5) Specify what you don't want using negative prompts if your generator supports them, and 6) Iterate by generating multiple images and refining your prompt based on results. Remember that even with perfect prompts, some randomness is inherent in the generation process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I create more cohesive sets of images with consistent style and characters?",
      "answer": "For cohesive image sets: 1) Create a 'style prompt' section that you use consistently across all images in the set, including specific artistic style, lighting, color palette, and rendering approach, 2) For character consistency, develop detailed character descriptions that you copy into each relevant prompt, 3) Use the same aspect ratio and composition approach across the set, 4) If your generator supports it, use seed numbers to maintain consistency between generations, and 5) Consider creating your images in a single session to benefit from the model's short-term 'memory' of your style preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any legal concerns with using AI-generated images commercially?",
      "answer": "The legal landscape for AI-generated images is evolving, but here are current best practices: 1) Check the terms of service for your specific AI image generator regarding commercial usage rights, 2) Avoid generating images of real people, celebrities, or trademarked characters/properties, 3) Be cautious with generating images that closely mimic specific artists' styles, especially for commercial use, 4) Consider AI-generated images as starting points that you further modify or incorporate into larger works, and 5) Keep records of your prompts and the fact that you generated the images. Some platforms like DALL-E grant commercial usage rights, while others may have restrictions."
