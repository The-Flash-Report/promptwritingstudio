      "question": "How can I make these business prompts more specific to my industry?",

For example, in the SWOT analysis prompt, include industry-specific challenges, regulations, or trends. You can also add industry benchmarks or standards that would be relevant to your analysis. The more specific context you provide, the more tailored the output will be."

    {
      "question": "Can ChatGPT replace business consultants or strategists?",
      "answer": "While ChatGPT can provide valuable frameworks, analyses, and starting points, it shouldn't completely replace human expertise. ChatGPT lacks real-time market insights, can't conduct primary research, and doesn't have industry experience. Use these prompts to supplement your thinking, save time on initial drafts, and explore options—but combine the outputs with your own business judgment and industry knowledge."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the financial projections or market analyses from these prompts?",
      "answer": "ChatGPT cannot provide accurate financial projections or market analyses based on current data. Any numbers generated are illustrative examples only. For accurate financial projections or market analyses, you should input your own data and assumptions, or use the output as a framework that you populate with real figures from reliable sources."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I update analyses created with these prompts?",
      "answer": "Business analyses should be updated regularly as market conditions change. For fast-moving industries, quarterly reviews are recommended. For more stable industries, semi-annual or annual updates may be sufficient. Use these prompts to refresh your analyses when you experience significant changes in your business, when new competitors emerge, or when market conditions shift."
