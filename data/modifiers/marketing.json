    {
      "question": "Can ChatGPT create truly original marketing ideas?",
      "answer": "ChatGPT generates content based on patterns in its training data, so while it can combine ideas in novel ways, it's not creating truly original concepts from nothing. Use ChatGPT's outputs as starting points that you then refine with your unique market insights and creative thinking. The most effective approach is to use these prompts to generate a variety of options, then apply your human creativity to develop the most promising ideas further."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I adapt these marketing prompts for different industries?",
      "answer": "For industry-specific adaptation, include relevant industry terminology, common customer pain points in that sector, regulatory considerations, and typical conversion paths. Research industry benchmarks for metrics like conversion rates or engagement rates to make the outputs more realistic. You might also specify competitor approaches that are common in your industry so ChatGPT can suggest differentiation strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I refresh my marketing content created with AI?",
      "answer": "Marketing content should be refreshed based on performance data and market changes. Monitor engagement metrics closely - when you see declining performance, it's time to refresh. As a general rule, social media content may need refreshing every 1-3 months, email sequences every 3-6 months, and core marketing messages annually. Always update content when your product features change, when competitors shift strategies, or when new trends emerge in your industry."
