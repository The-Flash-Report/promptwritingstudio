    {
      "question": "How do I know which investment strategy is right for me?",
      "answer": "The right investment strategy depends on three key factors: your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. Conservative investors typically prefer more bonds and stable investments, while aggressive investors can handle more stocks and volatility. Your timeline matters because longer time horizons allow you to ride out market fluctuations. Start by assessing your comfort level with potential losses, how long you can invest, and what you're trying to achieve. Many people start with a moderate approach and adjust based on their experience. Remember that diversification across different asset classes is more important than picking individual investments, and low-cost index funds often outperform actively managed funds over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to start investing with a small amount?",
      "answer": "Starting small is actually a great approach to investing! Begin with low-cost index funds or ETFs that provide instant diversification. Many platforms offer fractional shares, so you can invest in expensive stocks with just a few dollars. Consider starting with a target-date fund that automatically adjusts your asset allocation based on your retirement year, or a simple three-fund portfolio (US stocks, international stocks, and bonds). Set up automatic monthly investments to build the habit, even if it's just $25-50 per month. Focus on consistency rather than timing the market, and remember that compound interest works best over long periods. As your income grows, you can increase your investment amounts and add more sophisticated strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I save for an emergency fund?",
      "answer": "Most financial experts recommend saving 3-6 months of essential expenses in an emergency fund. Start with a goal of $1,000 to cover small emergencies, then build toward the full amount. Calculate your essential monthly expenses (housing, food, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments) and multiply by 3-6 months. If you have a stable job and single income, aim for 6 months. If you have multiple income sources or a partner with income, 3 months might be sufficient. Keep your emergency fund in a high-yield savings account that's easily accessible but separate from your regular checking account. Remember that this fund is for true emergencies like job loss, medical expenses, or major car repairs, not for planned expenses like vacations or home improvements."
